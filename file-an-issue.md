## Issue guidance

**Search first:** Search for duplicate issues to save time. [See all open GitHub issues](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues). Try and find issues that are exactly or closely related to the bug or feature request you want and provide feedback on the original issue. If none of the open issues resembly what you're looking at, file a new one.

**Use specific titles:** Provide clear titles and details, and share your research to help us understand your feedback.

**Separate bugs:** If there are multiple problems, submit them as separate issues.
