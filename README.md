# Model Builder

Model Builder is a UI tool in Visual Studio that lets you build, train and consume custom machine learning models in your applications.

With little to no machine learning expertise you can use this visual interface to connect to your data stored in files or SQL Server.

Model Builder leverages best in class automated machine learning (AutoML) to train and evaluate different algorithms. It produces the best model for your scenario and data without any tuning required from you.

After training, you can generate code for training and consuming this model in their applications.
