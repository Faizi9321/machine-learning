### Improvements 
- Change the extension of generated models from .zip to .mlnet. [Issue 1738](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1738) 
- Generated training code includes method to load IDataView from the source specified from Data. [Issue 2257](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2257)
- Generated consume code includes getting the predicted label category name for classification scenarios. [Issue 2399](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2399)
 
 #### Ignored columns
- In Recommendation and Text Classification, all columns not used are set to ignore state. This is to make it more clear that ML.NET won't use them in training. [Issue 2296](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2296) 
- Ignored columns aren't shown in Data _Data Preview_ or in Evaluate _Try your model_. [Issue 2115](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2115)
 
 ### General Bugs 
- Increased AzCopy version to 10.16.2. [Issue #2348](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2348)
- Generated projects cannot have the same name as the .mbconfig file to avoid naming collisions. [Issue 2412](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2412)
- Fast Forest Regression has an index out of bounds error. Model Builder has updated ML.NET reference to the fixed version. [Issue 2389](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2389)

### Text Classification Bugs
- Enable GPU prediction in generated code for Text Classification scenario. [Issue 2356](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2356)
- On Text Classification reload the Consume _Code snippet_ is not empty. [Issue 2383](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2383)
- Use new Text Classification scenario icon. [Issue 2374](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/2374)
