- Update to ONNX Runtime 1.9.0. [Issue 1775](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1775)
- Update to ML.NET 1.7.0 [Issue 1944](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1944)
- Binding expression characters (e.g. `.`, `()`. or `[]`) cause a problem in the Data Preview grid. [Issue 1105](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1105)
- Problems when switching from CPU to Azure for Image training. [Issue 1755](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1755) and [Issue 1267](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1267)
- GPU extension showing as missing when there is a version mismatch. Now we correctly inform the user to upgrade Model Builder and GPU extensions to have the same version number. [Issue 1751](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1751)
- Show helpful error when new .mbconfig file is opened. Model Builder should always know how to open old .mbconfig files, but in the future an old version of Model Builder might be used to try to open a newer version of .mbconfig file. We should handle this gracefully. [Issue 1818](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1818)
