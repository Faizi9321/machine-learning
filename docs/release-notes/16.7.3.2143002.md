### Improve consumption code 
- Update generated Web API Project to .NET 6 Minimal API. [#1605](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1605)
- Improve the performance of Predict method in Consumption.cs code file. [#1567](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1567) [#1419](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1419)

### Usability 
- Update to MLNet 1.6.0. ARM devices are now supported. [#1658](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1658)
- Fix SQL Server Authentication (SQL username and password) [#1540](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1540)
- Fix new Azure ML Workspace create experience. Users creating their first ML Workspace ran into a blocking key vault bug. This is now fixed. [#1104](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1104), [#1492](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1492), [#1654](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1654)
- Multiple installed version of CUDA do not block GPU training. Only requirment is Cuda 10.1 is installed and Cuda_Path_v10_1 is set. [#1642](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1642)
- Binary classification used when specified. Set label column type to "boolean" in the Advanced Data Options to use binary classification. [#1211](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1211)

### Performance
