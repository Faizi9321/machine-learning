## New Issues

#### Issues filed by customers 
These new issues should be looked at by the DRI.
1. Add the "Reported by: Customer" label. 
2. Try to reproduce and ask follow up questions.
3. Add to the [ML.NET DRI Project](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/projects) if we don't have enough information to reproduce the problem.
4. Add the "triage" label to anything you'd like PM/Lead to look at. 

#### Issues filed by tester/team
These are reviewed by PM/Lead during the weekly triage. Issues that should be fixed soon are added to the [ML.NET Tools Project](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/projects/107/views/1) and put in the current milestone

## Issues In progress
- Starting work: If not done already, add issue to the [ML.NET Tools Project](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/projects/107/views/1) and set the current active milestone. Move the issue to _In Progress_ column. 
- Open PR: Link the issue in the PR (or vice versa). Move the issue to the _In PR_ column. 

## Fixed issues
Fixed issues should be validated by a team member. Move the issue to _Validate_ column in the ML.NET Tools Project. 

## Validated Issues 
Once an issue is validated it should be moved to the _Done_ column. Not all _Done_ issues should be closed. Closing an issue depends on who filed it and when it was fixed. The goal is for customers to be able to understand the state of the product based on the issues.
- Issues filed by the tester/team on new features (never seen by customers) can be closed after being fixed. These are internal issues that can be closed as they do not impact customers. 
- Issues filed by customers should be kept open until their release. 
- New feature issues should be kept open until their release.
